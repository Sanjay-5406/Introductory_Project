        <h2>MYSELF:</h2>
        <p>As an enthusiastic amateur web developer, I am passionate about creating engaging and functional websites. My journey in web development began with a curiosity to understand how websites work and a desire to build my own. I have been learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy experimenting with different design elements and functionalities. Although I am still in the early stages of my web development career, I am committed to continuously improving my skills and expanding my knowledge. I am excited about the endless possibilities in web development and look forward to contributing to innovative projects in the future. More bout me in the following paragraphs.</p>
